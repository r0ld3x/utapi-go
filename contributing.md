# contributing

Currently this package has parity with the [UTApi class in Uploadthing](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/blob/main/packages/uploadthing/src/sdk/index.ts#L39), so this package doesn't require new features.

If you have modifications you'd like to make to the code for cleanliness or other improvements, I'd recommend getting in touch before making the changes.

## scope

This package should do nothing more than the [UTApi class in Uploadthing](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/blob/main/packages/uploadthing/src/sdk/index.ts#L39)

## utapi features

- [x] requestUploadThing
- [x] deleteFiles
- [x] getFileUrls
- [x] listFiles
- [x] renameFiles
- [x] getSignedURL
- [x] getUsageInfo

## dev setup

1. If you'd like to make a change, first clone the [Uploadthing](https://github.com/https://github.com/r0ld3x/utapi-go) repo and find the original function you plan to modify.

   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/https://github.com/r0ld3x/utapi-go uploadthing_source;
   cd uploadthing_source;
   ## I recommend starting in the below file - the core functionality is there
   vim packages/uploadthing/src/sdk/index.ts
   ```

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jesses-code-adventures/utapi-go;

   git checkout -b my_feature;
   ```
